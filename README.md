This Java application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for encrypting and decrypting messages using the AES encryption algorithm with a provided private key. Users can input a message along with a private key, encrypt the message, and then decrypt it back using the same or a different private key.

Usage Instructions:
Input Message and Private Key: Enter the message to encrypt and the private key in the respective text fields located at the top of the GUI.
Encrypt: Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the entered message using the provided private key.
Decrypt: Click the "Decrypt" button to decrypt the encrypted message. If decrypting, the application will prompt you to enter the private key again for decryption.
Requirements:
Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your system to compile and run the Java code.
How to Run:
Compile: Compile the Java file SimpleCryptoGUI.java using the following command:
javac SimpleCryptoGUI.java
Run: Run the compiled Java application using the following command:
java SimpleCryptoGUI
Graphical Interface: Once the application is running, a GUI window will appear where you can interact with the encryption and decryption functionalities.
Note:
This application utilizes the AES encryption algorithm, and it's essential to keep the private key secure.
Ensure that the private key is correctly entered and kept confidential, as it is crucial for both encryption and decryption processes.
If you encounter any errors or issues during encryption or decryption, the application will display error messages to guide you.
